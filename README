PURI - Portable URI Library

This is portable Universal Resource Identifier library for Common Lisp
programs. It parses URI according to the RFC 2396 specification. It's
is based on Franz, Inc's opensource URI package and hash been
ported to work other CL implementations. It is licensed with the
LLGPL as include in this distribution.

A regression package is include which uses Franz's open-source
tester library. I've also ported that library for use on other
CL implementations. Puri completes 126/126 regression tests
successfully.
