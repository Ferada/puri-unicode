PURI - Portable URI Library

Kevin Rosenberg <kevin@rosenberg.net>

This is portable Universal Resource Identifier library for Common Lisp
programs. It parses URI according to the RFC 2396 specification. It's
is based on Franz, Inc's opensource URI package and has been ported to
work other CL implementations. It is licensed under the LLGPL which
is included in this distribution.

A regression suite is included which uses Franz's open-source tester
library. I've ported that library for use on other CL
implementations. Puri completes 126/126 regression tests successfully.

Franz's unmodified documentation file is included in the file
uri.html. The only divergence in usage between Puri and Franz's
package is that Puri's symbols are located in the package PURI while
Franz's original uses the package NET.URI.
